I started using Python for the first time in my career about 8 months ago and thought I would look at making
a Python-based web application in my spare time.

I have decided to try out [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) which is a popular framework for building
web applications in using python and templates.  I hope to compare it to my experience using Java and Angular (v2).
