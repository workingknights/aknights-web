Finding some time on my hands between jobs I decided to launch my own website again after a 10 year departure.

I will aim to blog about some of the cool, interesting and confounding things I encounter as I continue my personal development and learn new languages, frameworks, tools, etc.

(I may also blog about non-tech related items occasionally tooâ€¦)
