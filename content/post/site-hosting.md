My most recent experience with site hosting after I took my previous personal site down a decade ago was on my motherâ€™s holiday home rental in Southern Italy.

To make content management easier for her I just purchased the namespace and a hosted-install of WordPress from GoDaddy.  But this time I thought I would look around and try out some other providers and see if I could provide more flexibility and shrink the cost further.

I came across [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and was able to get it up and running on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with my chosen theme in under 30 minutes.  It is highly customizable and as it is a static site generator it is fast to load in the browser.

Coupled with the continuous integration feature of Netlify when connected to a GitHub repo I can push content into production with a single command and be notified on my [Slack](https://slack.com/) channel when the deploy is started and when it succeeds or fails.
