My most recent experience with site hosting after I took my previous personal site down a decade ago was on my motherâ€™s holiday home rental in Southern Italy.

To make content management easier for her I just purchased the namespace and a hosted-install of WordPress from GoDaddy.  But this time I thought I would look around and try out some other providers and see if I could provide more flexibility and shrink the cost further.
